# Face-recognition-attendance-system

This project utilizes face recognition technology to automate attendance marking. It captures and matches faces from  images, and records attendance based on recognized faces.

Features
Automatic Attendance: Marks attendance when a recognized face is detected,
Face Recognition: Identifies faces from stored images using Dlib and OpenCV,
Simple Integration: Easy setup and configuration for new users.
Requirements:
Python 3.8.0,
OpenCV,
Dlib,
face-recognition,
Pandas,
NumPy,
Matplotlib 

Install the dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
